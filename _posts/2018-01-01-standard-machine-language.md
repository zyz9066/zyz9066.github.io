# Functional programming
### Functional Programming Languages
* Use functions, not objects or procedures
* Functions are the fundamental building blocks of a program.
* Allows the user to take on complex real world tasks.

### Standard Machine Language (SML)
* Evaluates expressions rather than executing sequences of statements.
* Allows the use of variables, assignment, and sequencing.

<!-- Datatypes -->
# Characters and strings
### SML
* Programming with characters and strings
* Specific syntax for characters: #"a";

<!-- Recursive functions -->
<!-- Analyzing Data Sequences
# Use SML to create lists
# Perform functions on lists
# Create datatypes that use lists -->
