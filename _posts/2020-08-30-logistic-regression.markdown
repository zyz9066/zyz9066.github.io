# Logistic Regression and Classification
Logistic regression is a machine learning classification algorithm used to assign observations to a discrete set of classes. Some of the well known examples of this kind of classification are **email spam or ham, transactions fraud, tumor malignant or benign**. Given a feature vector *X* and a qualitative response *Y* taking values in the set *C={C_1, ..., C_k}*, a classification task is to build a function $$f:X\to Y$$ (classifier) that takes the feature vector $$X$$ as input and predicts the value for $$Y$$, i.e. $$Y\in C$$.

#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
