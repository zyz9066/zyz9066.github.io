# Introduction
A heap is a binary tree which is:
* Complete
* Every node's key is larger than (or equal to) the keys of its children

# Building a heap
$$O(n\log_2n)$$
# Heap sort
Heap Sort: $$n\log_2n$$
<!-- Representing heaps using arrays -->
# Heaps as priority queues
Changing Key: $$O(\log_2n)$$
# Inserting an item in a heap
Fixing the heap: $$O(\log_2n)$$  
Get the max: $$O(1)$$
# Deleting the root
Deleting the root = $$O(1+\log_2n)=O(\log_2n)$$  
Put last element at root, Fix the heap
