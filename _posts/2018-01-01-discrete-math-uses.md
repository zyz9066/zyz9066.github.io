# Basics of discrete mathematics
### Definition
The study of mathematics that falls outside the realm of calculus.\\
Calculus is the study of continuous math concepts, whereas, this is discrete - the study of separable, countable, or quantified objects.

**TV Remote**:
* Power switch - either on/off.
* Volume button is variable and continuous.

### Core Concepts
* Logic
* Set theory
* Number theory
* Graph theory
* Combinatorics

**Discrete math involves mathematical reasoning in combination with creativity, and problem solving.**
# Discrete math for programming
### Foundation of Programming
**Computers**
* Computers operate in a discrete manner.
* Machine language is a series of binary bits and bytes.
* A bit has a value of either one or zero.
* Boolean operators are either true of fasle.
* Logical expressions evaluate to true or false.

1. If the customer owes money on their account.
2. If the account is more 60 days past due.
3. If the payment does not meet minimum due.

**Logical expression**\\
If the customer owes money AND if the customer is 60 days or more past due AND they have not made a payment that meets the minimum due.
### Programming examples
* While is it NOT end of file.
* While n is less than 10.
* While n is less than 10 but greater than zero.

### Programming Efficiency
* Evaluating algorithms to determine run time.
* Choosing the best sorting algorithm based on input size.
* Sample sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, and selection sort to name a few.

# Real-world discrete math
### Real-World Problems
**Logic** is The study of formal reasoning

How to prove your client is innocent.

|1:15 a.m.|Car ran a stop sign outside club.|
|1:30 a.m.|Defendant arrived at apartment which is 30 mins drive away from club.|

According to the timeline, my client is innocent.
### Summer Vacation
* Alaskan Cruise
* Calculate the cost of the trip
* Add kennel cost for boarding your dog
* Evaluate your budget compared to the cost of the trip
* Decide to postpone your trip

### Laws of eletronic device logic
* Turn on when room temperature gets too hot
* Stay on for at least 10 minutes
* Turn off when temperature is below a set threshold
* Turn off when manually push off button

# Abstract discrete math
### Abstract Math Problems
**Abstract Math**
* Justify the use of Math in applications.
* Requires conceptual reasoning about abstract ideas.
* Particularly understanding and constructing proofs.
* Prove theorems using mathematical ideas.

**Proofs**
* Absraction allows for solving complex problems.
* One supposes that a particular but arbitrarily chosen element `x` in `D` for which `P(x)` is true.
* Based on this, show that `Q(x)` must also be true.
* Now, we can generalize a more specific solution.

**Discrete Mathematics**
* Relatively few formulas to memorize.
* Instead, master fundamental concepts and apply them.
* Study of algorithms.
* An algorithm is a series of steps used to solve a problem.
