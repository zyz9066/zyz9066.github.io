# The World of Statistics
## Why statistics matter in life
Which numbers are good and which numbers are bad?
### Statistics
* Quantify uncertainty
* Discern biases

Where did the numbers come from?  
How were they calculated?  
Are they the right numbers?
## Is my data set good?

|Sex<br>Age<br>Address<br>Sales data<br>Browser statistics|

### Value of Information
Quality of data

How was the data gathered?
### Secondary Data
Collected by others

### Primary Data
Collected by you in natural environment or experiment

How was the data collected?  
Are there flaws in the data?  
Does the data gathering methodology impact the results?
## Understanding statistics with the use of charts
### Organized Data
* Provides service and convenience
* Enables good decision making
* Persuades
* Saves time and money

Organize all your data and it can tell you a story
* Data Table

# The Center of the Data
## The middle of the data: Means and Medians
A data set is a collection of values.
### Mean (Average)
The sum of all data points divided by the total number of observations
### Median
The midpoint of the data
## Medians for data sets with even numbers of data points
### Median
The midpoint in data with equal number of data points above and below

Actual mean
## Weighted mean
### Calculating Weighted Mean
### Weighted Mean: Examples
* Rate Employees
* Rate Suppliers
* Pick a home
* Pick a school

How were the categories and weights chosen?
### Creating a Weighted Mean: Considerations
* Categories
* Weight

### Rate These Rubrics
## The mode: Find it and understand it
* Mean
* Median
* Weighted mean

### Mode
The data point that is most prevalent in the data set
* Finding the mode
* No mode

The mode represents the most likely outcome in a data set.  
The mode does not have a minimum frequency.
### Mode: No Minimum Frequency
# Data Variablility
## The range
### Range
The difference between the largest and smallest values
## Standard deviation: calculate it and understand it
### Standard Deviation
*Sort of* the average distance from the mean  
The average squared distance from the mean  
$$s=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum\limits^{N}_{i=1}(x_i-\overline{x})^2}$$
### Statistics Tools
* Mean
* Median
* Mode
* Range
* Standard Deviation

$$\overline{x}$$ = mean  
n = sample size  
sample size - 1 = n - 1
## How many standard deviations?
### Consider what is being measured
* 68% $$\pm 1$$ standard deviation
* 95% $$\pm 2$$ standard deviation
* 99.7% $$\pm 3$$ standard deviation

## Outliers
A data point that is an abnormal distance from other values in a data set
### How can one identify outliers?
* Tables
* Charts

### What should be done with outliers?
### Outliers are Opportunities
Is this really an outlier?  
How did this happen?  
What can be learned?  
What needs to change?
# Distribution and Relative Position
## Z-score: Measuring by using standard deviations
Standard deviation helps identify outliers.
### Z-Score
$$z=\frac{x_i-\overline{x}}{s}$$
## Empirical rule: What symmetry tells us
Works for symmerically distributed data  
Symmetrically distributed data follows a pattern whereby most data points fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean  
Empirical Rule = Three Sigma Rule  
Sigma = Standard deviation
* 68% of data points are within 1 StDev
* 95% of data points are within 2 StDev
* 99.7% of data points are within 3 StDev

Only works with a well-centered, symmetrical bell-shaped curve
## Calculating percentiles: Where do you stand?
### Percentile Rank
$$%rank=[\frac{(\text{# of values below x})+0.5}{\text{Total # of values}}]100
# Probability Explained
## Defining probability
### Probability
The likelihood that some event will occur

$$\frac{\text{Desired outcome}}{\text{All possible outcomes}}$$
### Random Experiment: Tossing a coin
### Random Experiment: Rolling a pair of dice
## Examples of probability
### Even Odds
Weighted Odds
### Total Probability of a Sample Space
The sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes must add up to 100%  
The highest probability for any scenario is 100%  
The lowest probability for any scenario is 0%
## Types of probability
### Objective Probability
* Classical Probability  
* Empirical Probability

### Classical Probability
Two Outcomes:
* Heads
* Tails

### Empirical Probabilty
$$\frac{\text{Number of free-throws made}}{\text{Number of free-throw attempts}}$$
* Player health
* Fatigue
* Game situation

### Subjective Probabilities
Unemployment rate  
Consider the types of probabilities you will encounter
* Classical
* Empirical
* Subjective

# Multiple Event Probability
## Probability of two events: Either evnet? Both events?
### Addition Rule
$$\frac{\text{Event 1}}{\text{50%}}+\frac{\text{Event 2}}{\text{50%}}-\frac{\text{Overlap}}{\text{25%}}=75%$$
## Explanation of conditional probability: If X happens, then...
### Conditional Probability
The probability of an event, given that another has already occured
### Probability Tree
## Relationship between two events: Independence vs. dependence
### Independent Events
### Dependent Events
## Bays theorem and false positives
### Bayes Theorem
$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{\sum\limits_J P(B|A_J)P(A_J)}$$
# How Objects are Arranged
## Permutations: The order of things
$$\frac{\text{Desired event}}{\text{All possible outcomes}}$$
### Permuations
The number of ways in which objects can be arranged  
### Permuations: Formula
$$n!\div (n-x)!$$  
n = total number of objects  
x = number of objects to be selected
## Combinations: Permutations without regard to order
### Permutation
The order of events matter
### Combinations vs Permutations
The order of events do not matter
### Combinations: Formula
$$n!\div [(n-x)!x!]$$  
n = total number of objects  
x = number of objects chosen at one time
# Discrete vs. Continuous Probability Distributions
## Discrete vs. Continuous: What's the difference?

# Sampling
## Sample considerations
* What's happening now?
* What'll happen next?
* Where do we need to improve?
* What do our people think?
* What's normal?

The chanllenge is getting the right answers.
### Measuring Everything
* Too expensive
* Too time consuming
* Impossible

### Political Poll
Sample Size
* How many voters polled?
* Is 100 enough? 1000? 100,000?

Selection Process
* How are these people chosen?
* Who answered the survey?

Bias
* Which organization?
* Is data representative of population?
* Was the poll driven?

Measurement
* What were the questions?

THe best samples are chosen at random.
## Random samples
### Simple Random Sample
* Each individual has the same probability of being chosen at any stage.
* Each subset of k individuals has the same probability of being chosen as any other subset containing k individuals.

* Unbiased sample
* Independent data points

A simple random sample is one where every member of the population has an equal chance of being chosen.
### Phone Surveys
### In-Person Polls and Surveys
* Atraction / Intimidation
* Demographic Targeting

### Online Surveys
* Paid participation

### Independence
The selection of one member must not influence the selection of other units.
## Alternative to random samples
Alternatives to the simple random sample are sometimes utilized.
### Alternative Methods
* Simple to organize
* Easy to carry out
* Logical and sound

Sources of Bias
* Sampling time
* Sampling location

### Opportunity Samples
Source of Bias
* Location
* Age of children
* School setting
* Letter
* Motivations

### Stratified Sample

|Chocolate Chip|15|
|Peanut butter|3|
|Oatmeal|3|
|Sugar|3|
|Ginger|1|
|Snickerdoodle|2|
|Oatmeal Raisin|3|

### Cluster Sample
A cluster sample is similar to stratified samples in that we break things up into groups.
### Alternatives to Simple Random Sample
* Systematic sample
* Sources of bias
* Opportunity sample
* Stratified sample
* Cluster sample

# Sample Size
## The importance of sample size
A sample is a group of units drawn from a population.  
Sample size is the number of units drawn and measured for that particular sample.  
Larger sample = Greater accuracy  
Sample size is important  
$$\sigma_{\hat p}=\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$  
Bigger sample size = Smaller standard deviation
## The central limit theorem
### Distribution of Discrete Numbers
Now suppose we didn't want to tally up all 20 values, but we still wanted to find the average of the data set.
### Sample Means
The more samples we take, the closer the means of our sample means will get to the population mean.
## Standard error (for proportions)
The standard error is the standard deviation of our proportion distribution.
* Upper limit = p + Std Dev
* Lower limit = p - Std Dev

### Beyond Limits
1. Unique environment
2. Flaw in reported national average
3. Flaw in data gathering techniques
4. Market change
5. Bias in sampling

## Sampling distribution of the mean
## Standard error (for means)
Average of sample means comes with a standard error.  
$$\sigma_{\overline p}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}$$  
If we use larger sample sizes, our standard error gets smaller.
# Confidence Intervals
## One sample is all you need
Enough random samples = Excellent approximation of population means  
Larger sample size = Smaller standard deviation  
We're 95% confident that the average adult in the United States drinks between 2 and 3 liters of beverages per day.
## What exactly is a confidence interval?
## 95% confidence intervals for population proportions
Z-scores tell us how many standard deviations away from the mean we would need to be to capture a certain percentage of the total distribution.
### Data
Sample proportion = 0.55  
$$\sigma_{\overline x}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}\\
\sigma_{\overline x}=\frac{0.55}{\sqrt 100}\\
\sigma_{\overline x}=0.05$$  
Upper limit = 0.55 + 1.96 (standard deviation) = 0.55 + 1.96 (0.05) = 0.648  
Lower limit = 0.55 - 1.96 (standard deviation) = 0.55 - 1.96 (0.05) = 0.452
## Do you want to be more than 95% confident?
Upper Limit of Interval  
$$\hat p+1.96(\text{standard error})$$  
Lower Limit of Interval  
$$\hat p-1.96(\text{standard error})$$
## Explaining unexpected outcomes
### Polling Issues
1. Lying
2. Change of mind
3. Unsure respondents
4. Not a random sample

### Election Day Issues
1. Influence of uncontrolled events
2. Political event
3. Voter turnout

## 95% confidence intervals for population means
### Tougher Confidence Intervals
Average salary of cardiologist?  
Weight of average Texas grapefruit?  
Mile time of average female?
### 95% Confidence Interval
Upper Limit of Interval: $$\hat p+1.96$$ (sampling error)  
Lower Limit of Interval: $$\hat p-1.96$$ (sampling error)
### 95% Confidence Interval for Means
Upper Limit of Interval: $$\hat x+1.96$$ (sampling error)  
Lower Limit of Interval: $$\hat x-1.96$$ (sampling error)
### Statistics
# Hypothesis Testing
## Is this result even possible?
### Medicine Experiment
Average duration of cold = 8.5 days  
n = 250  
Recoverry time = 7.3 days

Is the result significant?  
Could this sample just be the result of chance or did this drug have an impact?  
Should the drug be tested further?  
Does this mean this new drug should be approved for use?
### What Statisticians Will Do
* Make an assumption
* Collect random samples
* Measure the samples
* Make a conclusions

### Hypothesis Testing
* Means, proportions, and standard deviations
* Normal distributions and z-scores
* The empirical rule
* Sampling and sample size
* Confidence Intervals

## How to test a hypothesisi in four
### Jury Duty Experiment
Town population = 35,000  
Percentage men = 50%  
Percentage women = 50%  
n = 50
### Step 1a) Develop Hypotheses

|$$H_0=$$ Null hypothesis<br>Jury numbers happened by chance<br>Shows odds of woman being picked as 50%<br>$$H_0$$ is $$p\le 0.50$$|$$H_a=$$ Alternative hypothesis<br>Jury numbers happened not by chance<br>Shows odds of woman being picked higher than 50%<br>$$H_a$$ is $$p>0.50$$|

### Step 1b) State Significance Level
Set threshold for test  
Significance level = 5%. If 36 or more women ending up on a jury have less than a 5% chance of occurring at random, then we will reject out null hypothesis.
### Step 2) Identify Test Statistic
Binomial probability  
p = 0.50
### Step 3) Determine P-Value
Looking for the probability that the number of women chosen for the jury-panel would be 36 or more  
Probability = 0.13%
### Step 4) Compare P-Value to Significance Level
The was only a 0.13% chance that at random 36 or more women would be chosen for a panel of 50 potential jurors.  
Alpha = 0.05 or 5%  
p-value < significance level  
It much more likely for a woman to be chosen versus a man.
## One-tailed vs. two-tailed tests
### 3 Scenarios
1. A recent national study found that the average American between the ages of 18-24 checks their phone 75 times per day. A mobile service provider questions these results.
2. The average amount of time it takes an adult to recover from the common cold is 8.5 days. A new medicine was tested on a sample of adults suffering from the common cold. The average recovery time for people in this group was 7.3 days. The company that developed this medicine thinks the drug should be considered for federal approval.
3. The national average for the college entrance exam is 1000 points. The Regent Test Prep Academy claims that their students consistently beat the national average.

### Phone Chcek
People between ages 18-24 check phone 74 times/day  
Average stated  
$$H_0:\mu = 74.0$$  
$$H_a:\mu\neq 74.0$$
### Common Cold
Average person recovers in 8.5 days, test group recovers in 7.3 days  
One-tail test  
$$H_0:\mu \ge 8.5$$  
$$H_a:\mu < 8.5$$  
$$H_0$$ says that patients do not recover faster with drug.  
$$H_a$$ says drug does have impact.
### College Entrance Exam
Similar to previous example  
$$H_0:\mu \le 1000$$  
$$H_a:\mu > 1000$$  
$$H_0$$ says students do not see increased test scores.  
$$H_a$$ says students do increase their scores.
## Significance test for proportions
### Political Candiate
n = 500  
Yes = 54%  
Hypothesis: Candidate will win the election.
### Step 1a) Develop Hypotheses
$$H_0:p\le 0.50$$ - Candidate loses.  
$$H_a:p>0.50$$ - Candidate wins.
### Step 1b) State Significance
5% significance level  
<5% chance of occuring = Reject $$H_0$$
### Step 2) Identify Test Statistic
$$z_p=\frac{\hat p-p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}=\frac{0.54-0.5}{\sqrt{\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{500}}}=1.79$$
### Step 3) Determine P-Value
$$z_p=1.79$$  
z-score = 0.9633  
p-value = 1 - 0.9633 = 0.0367
### Step 4) Compare P-Value to Fixed Significance
Fixed significance = 0.05  
p-value = .0367  
0.0367 < 0.05. Reject $$H_0$$
## Significance test for means (acceptance sampling)
### K-Nosh Sample Stats
n = 100  
Average weight = 20.1 lbs  
Standard deviation = 0.26 lbs
### Step 1a) Develop Hypotheses
$$H_0:\mu\ge 20.15lbs$$  
$$H_a:\mu <20.15lbs$$  
If we reject $$H_0$$, no shipments are made.
### Step 1b) State Significance
Significance level = 5%  
One-tail test
### Step 2) Identify Test Statistic
$$z_p=\frac{\overline x-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}}=\frac{20.10-20.15}{\frac{0.26}{\sqrt 100}}=-1.92$$
### Step 3) Determine P-Value
Our p-value is 0.0274
### Step 4) Compare P-Value to Fixed Significance
$$\alpha=0.05$$  
p-value = 0.0274  
$$\alpha>p-value$$ - Reject $$H_0$$
## Type 1 and type 2 errors
### Hypotheses
$$H_0=$$ No cancer  
$$H_a=$$ Cancer

Types of Statistical Errors  
$$H_0$$ is acttually:

||True|False|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Reject $$H_0$$|Type 1 Error|Correct|
|Accept $$H_0$$|Correct|Type 2 Error|

# Small Sample Sizes
## T-statistic vs. z-statistic
### Centril Limit Theorem
z-score  
Normally distributed  
Must know standard deviation
### Create Confidence Intervals
Unknown SD of population  
Use SD of single sample  
If n < 30, then z-score invalid
### T-Distribution
### Z vs. T
z-test:
* Compare sample to population
* Sample $$\leftrightarrow$$ population

t-test:
* Compare independent samples
* Multiple curves

|Sample Size|t-Test|
|:-:|:-:|
|3|4.303|
|10|2.262|
|20|2.093|
|100|1.98|

## T-score tables and degrees of freedom
n - 1  
n = 4  
Degree of Freedom (DOF) = 3
## Calculating confidence intervals using t-scores
### Exam Scores
New score range: 50-200 points  
Old average score: 130 points  
Confidence Interval: 96%
### Confidence Interval Calculation
UCL = Sample mean + (t-score)(approx standard error of the mean)  
LCL = Sample mean - (t-score)(approx standard error of the mean)  
$$\overline X$$ = 126  
t-score = 2.821  
$$SE_{\overline X}=\frac{S}{\sqrt n}=\frac{29.51}{\sqrt 10}=9.33$$
# Comparing Two Populations (Proportions)
## Explanation of two populations

Are young male drivers more likely to get into car accidents than young female drivers?  
Are people in Los Angeles more likely to be victims of violent crime than people in NYC?  
Are male HS teachers more likely to have higher salaries than female HS teachers?
### Experimental vs. Control Population
Aspirin vs. placebo  
Male vs. female drivers  
Los Angeles vs. New York  
Male vs. female high school teachers
## Set up a comparison
True difference of population proportions = Observed difference from samples +/- [Critical value $$\times$$ Standard error]
### Calculating Standard Error for Two Samples
$$SE=\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p_1}(1-\hat{p_1})}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p_2}(1-\hat{p_2})}{n_2}}$$
### Calculating Confidence Intervals
Upper limit = 0.0109 + (1.96 $$\times$$ 0.004)  
Lower limit = 0.0109 - (1.96 $$\times$$ 0.004)
## Hypothesis testing
What's the probability that our results happened by chance?
* Mutually exclusive statements
* Supported by sample data

### Step 1: Develop Hypotheses
Null ($$H_0$$): Population proportion PL - Population proportion ND = 0  
Alternative ($$H_1$$): Population proportion PL - Population proportion ND $$\ne$$ 0  
Significance Level = 5%
### Step 2: Identify Test Statistic
Z-statistic  
Test for difference between two proportions  
$$z=\frac{(\hat{p_1}-\hat{p_2})-(p_1-p_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p_1}(1-\hat{p_1})}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p_2}(1-\hat{p_2})}{n_2}}}$$

## Visualization (re-randomizing)
### Text vs. Digital
Randomization #1  
Median of A = 15  
Median of B = 14

Randomization #1  
Median of A = 13  
Median of B = 15
## Set up a confidence interval
### Text vs. Digital

|Digital group<br>n = 120<br>$$\overline x=16.2$$<br>SD = 2.5|Text group<br>n = 80<br>$$\overline x=14.1$$<br>SD = 3.6|

### Confidence Intervals
True difference of population means = Observed difference from samples +/- [Critical value $$\times$$ Standard error] = 2.1 +/- [1.96 $$\times$$ 0.462]
### Calculate Standard Error
$$SE=\sqrt{\frac{S_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{S_2^2}{n_2}}=\sqrt{\frac{2.5^2}{120}+\frac{3.6^2}{80}}=0.462$$
### Confidence Interval Calculation
UCL = 2.1 + (1.96 $$\times$$ 0.462)  
LCL = 2.1 - (1.96 $$\times$$ 0.462)
## Hypothesis testing
### Text vs. Online

|Online group<br>n = 120<br>$$\overline x=16.2$$<br>SD = 2.5|Text group<br>n = 80<br>$$\overline x=14.1$$<br>SD = 3.6|

Null hypothesis ($$H_0$$)  
Population mean score for video - Population mean score for text = 0

Alternative hypothesis ($$H_1$$)  
Population mean score for video - Population mean score for text > 0

Alpha value = 1% or 0.01
### Hypothesis Test
1% significance level  
Reject $$H_0$$ if outcome has less than 1% chance of occuring  
z = 2.33  
If outcome is > 2.33 SD away from 0, then reject $$H_0$$

Need to know size of 1 SD  
Only have sample data  
Large sample size, so Standard error = Standard deviation

$$\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}=\sqrt{\frac{2.5^2}{120}+\frac{3.6^2}{80}}=0.462$$  
$$z=\frac{(\overline{x_1}-\overline{x_2})-(\mu_1-\mu_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1}{n_1}+\frac{\sigma_2}{n_2}}}=4.53$$

SSR = Sum of squares regression  
SST = Total sum of squares
### SSR
$$(\hat y-\overline y)^2$$
### SST
