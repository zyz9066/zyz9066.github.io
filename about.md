This site was created to keep notes about learning computer science, and most of the notes is from the [lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com) course. While this blog has many posts detailing computer science components, it's not prepared to be a tutorial for using specific programming language. For that, check out the lynda.com course. The main repo for this site contains the notes for these courses.
